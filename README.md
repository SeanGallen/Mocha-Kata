<b>Learning Mocha Kata.</b><br>
<br>
Right now, I have a simple Calculator with some functionality.<br>
At times, I will add tests just to try them out even if the program does not need it.


Test I have used so far:
Assert
beforeEach/Root Level

Reporter:
doc


Plans for the future:
<ul>
<li>Use other parts of Mocha.</li>
<li>Use Add-ons like Chai, should.js and Stubs.</li>
<li>Should testing results in the browser.</li>
<li>Test httml and DOM.</li>
<li>Create something more exciting than a calculator.</li>
</ul>

Tests for html project.
  document.images
  change an images's attributes.
  document.getElementById("exam")
  document.getElementById("myBtn").onclick = displayDate;
