Learning Mocha Testing for Javascript.
I created a simple Calculator with some functionality.
Only using Assert right now.

Plans for the future:
<ol>
<li>Use other parts of Mocha.</li>
<li>Use Add-ons like Chai, should.js and Stubs.</li>
<li>Test httml and DOM.</li>
<li>Create something more exciting than a calculator.</li>
</ol>
